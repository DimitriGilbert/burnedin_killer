#Burn in killer
##A simple html/js lcd burn remover
###Because it doesn't happen only to others...

>I created this simple HTML/javascript utility to get rid of an LCD burned in image.
>After a week end away where i let my laptop running, the image of the website I left it on was burned into my display...
>So after a litle bit a research other the internet i found that displaying bright color rapidly changing on my screen could actually help getting rid of that.
>So i created a javascript function to do that in a webbrowser, let it run for the night and, tada..nothing left :)
>
>Here is how it works
>>1. choose how you want it to run
>>2. choose how fast you want the color to change
>>3. RUN !
>
>and voila, as simple as that ;)
>I don't guarantee any result but it worked for me so I thought i'd share it
